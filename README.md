Modules: 

1) core - module with layers and NeuralNetwork object. There are fully connected layer, convolution layer and max pooling ( only 2D), Flatten and rnn layers (base recurrent and LSTM).

2) intializers - module with random weights initializers for layers.

3) activations - module with activations for layers.

4) losses - module with losses for neural networks.

5) utils - module for some custom thing for other modules.

6) load - module for fast loading MNIST dataset if you want to check workability of convolution layers.
